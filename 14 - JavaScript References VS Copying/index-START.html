      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const players1 = players;
      console.log(players1);

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      players[0] = "Hwang";

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      console.log(players);

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      let players2 = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
        players2.push(players[i]);
      }
      console.log("players2", players2);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      let players3 = [];
      players3 = players3.concat(players);
      console.log("players3", players3);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      let players4 = [...players];
      console.log("players4", players4);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      players.push("hello my name is yeppi yeppi yo");
      console.log(players2);
      console.log(players3);
      console.log(players4);

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const person1 = { ...person };

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      console.log("person1", person1);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
